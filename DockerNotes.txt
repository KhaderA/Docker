Docker Networking:
------------------
Basics:
1) Three pillars of Docker networking
- CNM(Container Network Model):
	DNA of Docker networking
	CNM is a specification document or design documentation for Docker Networking. Reference link https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/docs/
	Fair to say, libnetwork and drivers draw things from CNM
	
	CNM defines 3 major constructs,
	1) Sandbox (just the namespace in linux, other term in other OS)
	   - Isolated space in OS where we can create the fullnetwork stack like ipconfig, DNS, routing tables etc.
		2) Endpoints
		- These are Network interfaces like etho, eth1 etc
	3) Network
		- Network is a collection/grouping of endpoints
- libnetwork
	Libnetwork is the real implementation of CNM by Docker INC. written in Go/GoLang.
	Central place for all Docker Networking logic, API, UX etc.

- drivers
	Network specific details.
	Each network type has its own driver. 



Use Cases & Drivers:
	1) Single Host Networking
		Default single host network is bridge network, it comes with bridge driver.
		This network will be available only on the host server we create it.

	2) Multi Host Networking
		Docker provides out of the box multi host network called overlay 


Network Services:





Network Scope:
1) local
2) Swarm mode
