Docker Swarm:
- A collection of docker engines in known as swarm
- And a docker engine running in each host is said to be running in swarm mode
- swarm contains manager nodes(acts also as a worker) and worker nodes
- service is the instruction we give to docker swarm to perform some action. Any action on the swarm mode is done as a service using the keyword 'service' in the docker command
- task is the command given by master to worker node to execute some action

docker swarm setup:

1) Manager nodes
 - khadernode1.docker.com
   192.168.0.121
 - khadernode2.docker.com
   192.168.0.122
 - khadernode3.docker.com
   192.168.0.123
   
2) Worker nodes
 - khadernode4.docker.com
   192.168.0.124
 - khadernode5.docker.com
   192.168.0.125
 - khadernode6.docker.com
   192.168.0.126
   
 hostfile config:
192.168.0.121 khadernode1.docker.com
192.168.0.122 khadernode2.docker.com
192.168.0.123 khadernode3.docker.com
192.168.0.124 khadernode4.docker.com

- Initialize swarm
ubuntu@khadernode1:~$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.0.121:2377 --listen-addr 192.168.0.121:2237
output:
Swarm initialized: current node (q7pm4zrrd4oe5sd9lnj8y2chk) is now a manager.
To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-6acnrf6z5w16fj6hau9zn38cmrzo9hf03iuqdme2jfos8uh9gu-4ma8k0xcujjsi677gxfdr18sf 192.168.0.121:2377
To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

- To list the details of manager and worker nodes
docker node ls

- To join a node as  a worker or manager to swarm, run the below command on leader manager node to get exact command that needs to be executed on the specific node(to be added as worker/manager)
docker swarm join-token manager
docker swarm join-token worker
